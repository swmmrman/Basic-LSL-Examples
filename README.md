# Basic-OSSL-Examples
This is a repo of basic scripts I have created many times.  These scripts are all free to use for any purpose.  However, they may not be fully complete.  They are examples.  Most will make use of OSSL where possible and benificial.  There will be no effort to make sure these scripts work in Second Life.  They are intended only for OpenSim, or OpenSim dervived Virtual worlds.
